** 	b)  Communication plan to include project artifact repository**

  a. We conduct scrum call on zoom twice a week for providing update from everyone's end on project
  
  b. JIRA dashboard has been created to track task using agile methodologies (https://kiranbagwe.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/I6G1/boards/1)
  
  c. Github link with project repository has been also created (https://github.com/kbagwe/ITCS_6100_group_18)
  
  
  
**2)  Selection of data to analyze from the Open Data Registry for Amazon Web Services https://registry.opendata.aws/ **

**3)  Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge (link to information on domain relative to data, problem, or opportunity)**

**4)  Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)**

   a. Pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip lengths, itemized rates, rate kinds, payment methods, and driver-reported passenger counts are all captured in the yellow and green cab trip records. Technology providers authorized under the Taxicab and Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP) gathered and supplied the data utilized in the linked datasets to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).
   
   b. By identifying the maximum number of times a taxi has been dropped and picked by, we can create an analysis to determine whether the particular place should have taxis access all the time
   
   c. Same with the pick-up and drop-off time range we can determine the time when there is maximum requirement of taxis 
   
   d. Comparison between yellow taxis, green taxis, for-hire taxis, and High Volume of For-hire vehicles is done so that the importance of each taxi at a particular place and time can be determined.
   
   e. Data helping TLC to provide licenses to access which type of taxis and why
